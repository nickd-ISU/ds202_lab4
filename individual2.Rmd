## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
defense <- read_excel('cyclonesFootball2019.xlsx', sheet='Defensive')
str(defense)

defense <-defense %>% rename(Opponent=Opponent_Opponent) %>% mutate(Opponent=factor(Opponent))
defense <-defense %>% mutate(Name=factor(Name))
lvls <- as.character(sort(unique(defense$Opponent)))
lvls <- c('UNI', lvls[lvls != 'UNI'])
defense <- defense %>% mutate(Opponent = factor(Opponent, lvls))

defense <- defense%>%mutate_at(c("Tackles_Solo","Tackles_ASST","Tackles_TFL","Tackles_Sack","Turnover_FF","Turnover_FR","Turnover_INT","Pass_QBH","Pass_PB"),as.numeric)
str(defense)


```
